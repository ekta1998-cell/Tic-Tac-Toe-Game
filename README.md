# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game


## Overview
This project is a browser-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game that allows two players to compete in a turn-based game. The game is built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with form handling and object creation managed by JavaScript.

## Features
- **Player Name Configuration**: Players can input their names before starting the game.
- **Game Restart**: The game board and "Game Over" message can be reset with a "Start Game" button.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: The game alternates turns automatically between the two players, with each player assigned a unique symbol (X or O).
- **Clickable Game Fields**: Players can click on game board fields to place their symbol, and the game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- **Game Over Window**: At the end of the game, a "Game Over" message displays the winner or indicates a draw.

## Technologies Used
